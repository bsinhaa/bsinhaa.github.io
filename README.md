<h2 style="text-align:left;">Coffee Beans Basics: Types, Roasts, and how to store it</h2>
     <h3 style="text-align:left;font-style:italic;"> Types </h3>
        <p><strong><span>Coffee</span></strong> beans vary in their size, shape, color, and flavor depending on the region and conditions in which they were grown.</p>
        <p> Arabica: Arabica coffee is considered superior to Robusta because of its delicate flavor and low acidity. </p>
        <p> Robusta: Robusta coffee tends to have a more acidic and harsh flavor than Arabica as well as higher levels of caffeine. </p>
        <h3 style="text-align:right;font-style:italic;"> Roasts</h3>
        <p><strong><span>To</span></strong> prepare the green coffee bean for brewing, it must first be roasted.</p>
                <p> Light: Light roasts provide the lightest, most delicate flavors and can often be more acidic.</p>
        
        <p> Medium: Medium-roasted beans will have a chocolate brown color, dry surface, and a full flavor.</p>
        <p>Dark: Dark-roasted coffee is roasted until the sugars begin to caramelize and the oils begin to rise to the surface of the bean. Depending on the darkness of the roast, the bean may have a slight sheen or an oily appearance. </p>
        <p>Blends: To achieve unique flavor profiles, many roasters will create custom blends of beans with two or more roasting levels. </p>

    <p> Proper storage of coffee has a great impact on the flavor of the brewed cup. Enemies to coffeeâ€™s flavor include heat, oxygen, light, and moisture.Traditional cakes, jelly and desserts for you!</p> 
       <p> Most commercial coffee today is sold in vacuum-sealed bags with one-way valves to allow gasses to escape while keeping oxygen out.</p>
    <p> Once the seal on the bag is broken, extra care must be taken to keep the beans fresh.</p>
    <p>At home, coffee beans should be stored in an airtight container in a cool, dark, and dry place.</p>
    <p>After roasting or once the seal is broken on a vacuum-sealed bag, it is best to use the beans within two weeks. To learn more please contact Rolling Hills Coffee Co at 541-279-1503 <FORM>
